Welcome to the change log for the TextQuest project.

<h4>V 0.0.5b - 8/22/18</h4>
This version is broken (hence the b). It is attempting to reconcile and fix a bunch of changes. Once we get a stable version we'll go to 0.0.6.
<h4>V 0.0.4 - 9/xx/17</h4>
<b>Game Features:</b><br/>
-Add locked doors<br/>
-Saving your hero<br/>
-Properly exit from boss fight<br/>
-Travel between dungeons and other locations<br/>
-Add ability to read notes<br/>
-Add action inference (so if we receive "stats" we will infer "view stats")<br/>
-Add travel to room ("Go back to guardroom")<br/>
<b>Programming/"Internal" Features</b><br/>
-Converting from Thymeleaf to Mustache (gave Thymeleaf a try and I'm not a fan)<br/>
-Improve error handling to display errors<br/>
-Make various "action listeners" be able to pull from the same pool of actions and accept arguments.
For example, onSmash can be "giveExp" but onPickup can only be "crackFloor".<br/>

<h4>V 0.0.3 - 8/30/17</h4>
A lot of changes and additions to make the game more playable:<br/>

<h4>V 0.0.2 - 8/21/17</h4>
First version of the app put together as a web app. A lot of work done to convert to Spring.
