<h4>V 0.0.2 - 8/21/17</h4>
First version of the app put together as a web app. A lot of work done to convert to Spring.
<h4>V 0.0.1</h4>
This was the discovery phase. Originally a CLI-based app, a lot of work to convert to a Spring App.<br/>

<b>Game Features:</b><br/>
-Add locked doors<br/>
-Saving your hero<br/>
-Properly exit from boss fight<br/>
-Travel between dungeons and other locations<br/>
-Add ability to read notes<br/>
-Add action inference (so if we receive "stats" we will infer "view stats")<br/>
-Add travel to room ("Go back to guardroom")<br/>
<b>Programming/"Internal" Features</b><br/>
-Converting from Thymeleaf to Mustache (gave Thymeleaf a try and I'm not a fan)<br/>
